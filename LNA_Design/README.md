# 500 MHz Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA) â€” Design & Optimization

**Role:** RF design, simulation, PCB implementation and measurement.  
**Tools / Platform:** Keysight ADS, Smith Chart analysis, Vector Network Analyzer (VNA), PCB assembly.

**What I did**
- Designed bias network and matching networks for a BFR520 NPN transistor amplifier.
- Explored Tapped-C and LC matching topologies and iteratively tuned components to reach target S-parameters.
- Measured S11 and S22 near 500 MHz after tuning.

**Highlights**
- Practical improvement from theoretical topology to real PCB implementation.
- Demonstrated the effects of parasitics and manufacturing tolerances, and iterated to reach acceptable matching and gain trade-offs.
